--echo # Bug#46922: crash when adding partitions and open_files_limit is reached
#
# Note:
# The test script ask for open_files_limit=5
# The server silently increase that to 5000 before asking the OS
# The OS may (or may not) reduce open_files_limit, typically to 1024
# So, for the ADD PARTITIONS to really reach the 'Too many open files'
# error, the test script attempts 5001 partitions, will likely fail earlier
# The statement may still pass without errors,
# if the OS limit is much higher (unlikely, causing a test failure).
# Check the OS value with ulimit -n and change the test accordingly.
