# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test script serves as the functionality testing for
# WL#6120- Change master without stopping Slave threads.
#
# This test script does the following:

#  - Temporary table(s) should NOT be dropped if applier is running during
#    CHANGE MASTER.
#  - If there are open temporary tables and there is a CHANGE MASTER,
#    there should be a warning. Note there there is no warning if the
#    change master option only changes connection or execution configuration.
#  - If there are open temporary tables and there is a STOP SLAVE,
#    there should be a warning.
#  - Ensure that CHANGE MASTER is allowed if there are open temporary
#    tables.
#
