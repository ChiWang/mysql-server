                 MySQL Cluster NoSQL API for Node.JS

INTRODUCTION
------------
The NoSQL API for Node.JS provides lightweight domain object mapping for 
JavaScript.  The API can be used with two separate backend adapters:

  - The "ndb" adapter, which uses the C++ NDB API to provide
    high-performance native access to MySQL Cluster. 

  - The "mysql" adapter, which uses the node-mysql driver,
    available from https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql/


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Building the ndb backend requires an installed copy of MySQL Cluster 7.x 
including  headers and shared library files.  The MySQL architecture must match
the node architecture: if node.js is 64-bit, then MySQL must also be 64-bit.  If 
node is 32-bit, MySQL must be 32-bit.

The mysql backend requires version 2.0 of node-mysql, an all-JavaScript 
MySQL client.


BUILDING
--------
The installation script is interactive.  It will try to locate a suitable copy 
of MySQL, and it will prompt you to accept its choice or enter an alternative.

 * To build the module in place, type:

    setup/build.sh
    
         - OR -

 * To build and install the module, type:
  
    npm install .

TESTING
-------
Testing currently requires a running MySQL Cluster. The MySQL server must have
the database "test" created. The mysql client executable must be in the path.
By default, all servers are on the local machine on their default ports; this 
can be customized by editing test/test_connection.js

To run the test suite:

cd test
node Driver
