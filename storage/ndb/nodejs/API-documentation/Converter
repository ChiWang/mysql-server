/*   
   Converter classes convert between JavaScript types and MySQL types.
   If a user supplies a javascript converter, and it will be used to read 
   and write the database.

   Converters have several purposes:
    - To convert between MySQL DECIMAL types and a user's preferred JavaScript
      fixed-precision utility library
    - To convert between MySQL BIGINT types and a user's preferred JavaScript 
      big number utility library
    - To serialize arbitrary application objects into character or binary columns
 
   In the NDB backend (but not the MySQL backend), Converters are also used 
   to support SET and ENUM columns.
 
   A converter class implements two functions: 
      toDB(obj)  : convert obj, an application object, into a simple form 
                   which will be stored in the database 
      fromDB(val): convert val, a value read from the database,
                   into an application object form
   Each function returns the result of the conversion.   
   
   Converter invocations are chained in the following way:
   
   When writing to the database, first the registered FieldConverter, if any,
   is invoked.  Later, any registered TypeConverter is invoked.

   When reading from the database, first the registered TypeConverter, if any,
   is invoked.  Later, any registered FieldConverter is invoked.
